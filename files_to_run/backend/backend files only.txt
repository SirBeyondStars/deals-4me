Deals-4Me — BACKEND PROCESSING
===========================================

This folder contains all HEAVY LOGIC used by
Deals-4Me. These scripts power ingestion, OCR,
weekly exports, and other backend tasks.

These files should NOT be directly run by users;
they are called by admin tools.

-------------------------------------------
FILES IN THIS FOLDER SHOULD:
-------------------------------------------
✔ Run ingestion for all stores or a single store
✔ Call Python to parse flyers and generate exports
✔ Run OCR on PDFs or PNGs
✔ Process raw_images and raw_pdfs
✔ Handle week overrides
✔ Manage store-specific ingest rules

-------------------------------------------
FILES IN THIS FOLDER SHOULD NOT:
-------------------------------------------
✘ Display menus or UI tools
✘ Handle renaming or preparing week folders
✘ Do cleanup, archiving, or pruning tasks

-------------------------------------------
NOTES:
-------------------------------------------
All complex code should go here.

If it affects parsing, OCR, ingestion,
or involves Python → it belongs here.
